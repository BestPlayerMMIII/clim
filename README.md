# CLIM Project: Command Line Interface Multimedia

Welcome to the **CLIM Project**, an experimental tool for converting multimedia files into a custom format (`.clim`) and playing them directly in the command line as colored "pixels" (spaces). This project is an initial version, developed as a learning exercise in multimedia processing, compression, and command-line visualization. It is designed for experimentation and feedback.


## Features
1. **Converter**:
   - Converts multimedia files (e.g., MP4, AVI) into the `.clim` format.
   - Compresses data efficiently for lightweight command-line playback.

2. **Player**:
   - Displays `.clim` files in the terminal using background-colored characters.
   - Cross-platform support for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

3. **YouTube Downloader**
This project includes a Python script that uses the public library `yt_dlp` for downloading videos from YouTube.  

**Disclaimer:**  
- The library `yt_dlp` is distributed under the [Unlicense license](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/LICENSE), allowing open and unrestricted use.

## Example Workflow
1. Download a video from YouTube:
   ```bash
   python yt_downloader.py https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBJa32lCaaY -o videos/video
   ```
   A file "video.mp4" should appear in the folder "videos".

2. Convert the downloaded video:
   ```bash
   python -m Converter.main videos/video.mp4 clims/video.clim
   ```
   A file "video.clim" should appear in the folder "clims".

3. Play the converted file in the terminal:
   ```bash
   "./Player/player" --loop clims/video.clim
   ```

**Note**:

- to interrupt the video execution press ctrl+C;
- if you want the video to start in another CLI add `start` before the command:
   ```bash
   start ./Player/player --loop clims/video.clim
   ```

**Expected result for the example**

You got rickrolled by a CLIM file in a Command Line Interface (before GTA 6).

## CLIM File Format Documentation

The CLIM file format is a binary format designed to store compressed video efficiently, balancing storage space and computational performance. The file is structured into **mode**, **header**, **clustered video content**, and optional **audio data**, following a standard layout.


### Binary Structure of the CLIM File

#### 1. Mode Byte `M` (1 byte)
   - The first byte specifies the **mode** of the file.
   - Structure of `M`: `m7 m6 m5 m4 m3 m2 m1 m0`:
     - **`m0`**: Always `1`, indicating a valid file.
     - **`m1`**: Format type:
       - `0`: Standard format (documented here).
       - `1`: Reserved for future formats.
     - **`m2-m7`**: Undefined, reserved for future use.


#### 2. Standard Format Header (11 bytes)
   - **Width (`W`, 2 bytes)**:
     - Frame width in pixels, stored as an unsigned 16-bit integer.
     - Maximum supported width: **65,536 pixels**.
   - **Height (`H`, 2 bytes)**:
     - Frame height in pixels, stored as an unsigned 16-bit integer.
     - Maximum supported height: **65,536 pixels**.
   - **Milliseconds Between Frames (`MSBF`, 2 bytes)**:
     - Specifies the time between frames in milliseconds, as an unsigned 16-bit integer.
     - Frame rate range: from **0.015 FPS** ($` \frac{1000\; ms}{2^{16}\; msbf} `$) to **1,000 FPS** ($` \frac{1000\; ms}{1\; msbf} `$).
   - **Index of the First Byte for Audio (`IFBA`, 5 bytes)**:
     - Specifies the byte index where audio data begins.
     - Up to **1,024 GiB of video data** before the audio section starts.


#### 3. **Clustered Video Content**
   - **Clustering Header (`CH`)**:
     - A variable-length header describing the structure and metadata of the clusters that follow.
   - **Clusters**:
     - Each cluster represents a portion of video data compressed using one of the following methods:
       - **Huffman Coding**: Directly compresses pixel sequences based on frequency.
       - **Run-Length Encoding (RLE)**: Compresses repeated pixel sequences as `(pixel, count)`.
       - **RLE + Huffman**: Compresses the lengths of repeated sequences using Huffman, storing these instead of direct counts.
      

#### 3. **Audio Data**
   - Stored in binary MP3 format, starting at the byte index specified by `IFBA`.


### Compression and Processing

#### FlatFrame and Encoding
Frames are converted into a flat representation (FlatFrame), transforming a 2D matrix into a 1D sequence:
- Pixels are processed **row by row**, left to right.
- This simplifies the compression process and ensures compatibility with methods like RLE.

#### Huffman and RLE Methods
The encoding dynamically selects the most efficient compression method based on the frame content:
1. **Huffman Only**: Optimized for data with frequent patterns.
2. **RLE Only**: Effective for frames with many repeated pixel sequences.
3. **RLE + Huffman**: Combines the advantages of both methods, compressing run lengths with Huffman for additional efficiency.

### Why to use a maximum of 255 Pixels per Cluster?

#### Optimal Cluster Size: 255 Pixels
- **Technical Rationale**:
  - **Byte Alignment**: A maximum of 255 pixels allows each cluster length to be represented with a single byte, reducing overhead.
  - **Processing Efficiency**:
    - Larger clusters increase decoding complexity and memory usage.
    - Smaller clusters result in too many headers, causing unnecessary overhead.
  - **Compression Balance**:
    - Tests show that 255 pixels per cluster strikes the best balance between compression efficiency and decoding speed.
- **Experimental Validation**:
  - Simulations on a variety of video data confirm that this size minimizes storage while maintaining fast access times.
- **Computational Simplicity**:
  - Using a single-byte index (0â€“255) simplifies coding logic and ensures compatibility with lightweight decoding systems.


### Perception of Color in Humans

#### Physiological Limits
- The human retina has three types of cones sensitive to different wavelengths: red, green, and blue.
- Humans can perceive approximately **10 million colors**, but not all simultaneously (this range is the chromatic gamut).

#### Just Noticeable Difference (JND)
- Under ideal conditions, humans can detect differences as small as **2% in luminance or hue**.
- At low resolutions, spatial details limit perceivable color variations.

#### Resolution Example: 103x29 (2,987 pixels)
- In such a restricted space, the human eye cannot discern all theoretically possible color differences.
- Limited spatial resolution reduces the effective range of perceivable chromatic variations.


### Psycho-Perceptual Factors

#### Peripheral Vision
- Humans are more sensitive to **luminance variations** (light and dark) than **chrominance** (color), especially in peripheral vision.
- For low-resolution videos, distinct but limited color palettes improve visual clarity and immersion.

#### Reduced Impact of Wide Color Gamut
- Technologies like HDR and extended RGB color spaces support millions of colors.
- However, at low resolutions, their utility diminishes significantly.


### Evidence-Based Recommendation

#### Optimal Palette Size
- A palette of **200â€“256 colors** is sufficient for most human applications at low resolutions (e.g., 103x29).
- This balance ensures:
  - Immersion and clarity.
  - Computational efficiency.

### Practical Conclusion
For a typical user viewing a video at **103x29 resolution**, a palette with up to **256 colors** is probably almost indistinguishable from one with millions of colors. Increasing the number of colors further adds computational overhead without enhancing visual perception or immersion.
